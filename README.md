# Predictive-Analysis-of-Customer-Bookings-at-British-Airways
An end-to-end data science project that encompasses web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to unveil insights into airline customer booking behavior. 

This project takes a deep dive into the airline industry's customer booking patterns, starting from the ground up with web scraping to collect customer review data from airline review websites. The journey begins with meticulously cleaning and preprocessing the gathered data to prepare it for detailed exploratory analysis. Through this exploration, we uncover the underlying patterns and trends in customer behavior, preferences, and the overall sentiment towards airline services. This foundational analysis sets the stage for the predictive modeling phase, where machine learning techniques, specifically RandomForest and XGBoost models, are employed to predict customer booking decisions. The models are fine-tuned and evaluated for their precision, recall, and overall accuracy to ensure robust predictive capabilities.

Building on this foundation, the project goes a step further to analyze the features most influential in driving bookings. Through feature importance analysis and advanced model evaluation techniques, we gain valuable insights into the factors that most significantly impact customer decisions to book a flight. This not only provides a strategic advantage in targeting potential customers but also offers actionable recommendations for airlines to enhance their services and marketing strategies. The entire project, from data collection to predictive modeling, showcases the power of combining web scraping with machine learning to extract meaningful insights from raw data, thereby offering a comprehensive view of customer booking behavior in the airline industry.
